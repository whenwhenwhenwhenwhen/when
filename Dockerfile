# Stage 2: Publish the built site as a file-only image.
#
# This image is not meant to be run. It carries no web server or entrypoint:
# the deployment host extracts /srv/www out of it (docker create + docker cp)
# and the reverse proxy in front serves those files directly, with the runtime
# /config.json rendered by the host next to them. See docs/deployment.md.
